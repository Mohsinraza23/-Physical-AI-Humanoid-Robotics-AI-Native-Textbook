## 🚀 Introduction
This is **not a normal textbook**.  
This is the **first fully AI-native educational platform** that teaches **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** — completely generated by autonomous AI agents.

No human wrote a single chapter.  
Everything — from content to code to design — was created using a multi-agent system powered by **SpecifyPlus**.

# Spec-Kit Plus Constitution  
# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — AI-Native Textbook System  
# Gemini 2.5 Flash Edition — Multi-Agent, RAG, Urdu Translation, Personalization

constitution:

  version: 1.0

  purpose: |
    This constitution defines the governing rules, workflow, terminology,
    quality bar, and constraints for producing a fully AI-native technical
    textbook and RAG system using Spec-Kit Plus, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude Code,
    and Qdrant Cloud.  
    It ensures all generated outputs (specifications, plans, tasks, and
    implementations) follow a unified structure, are verifiable, and produce a
    complete hackathon-ready textbook platform.

  guiding_principles:
    - All outputs must be deterministic, structured, testable, complete,
      and technology-agnostic unless the phase explicitly requires implementation detail.
    - The LLM must never hallucinate features or add unstated requirements.
    - Every requirement must map to tasks; every task must map to implemented files.
    - UI/UX must follow professional textbook standards (clean, readable, academic).
    - Multi-agent architecture must remain modular and maintainable.
    - The RAG system must be accurate, high-recall, and citation-focused.
    - Translation workflows must maintain semantic accuracy in Urdu.
    - Personalization logic must respect user background metadata.
    - All components must meet the hackathon scoring criteria.

  definitions:
    ai_native_book: "A technical textbook built with Docusaurus that supports AI assistance, RAG, translation, personalization, and interactive features."
    rag_system: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture including chunking, embeddings, vector search, and answer generation."
    agent: "An AI module with a specialized function (retrieval, translation, personalization, file-writing, planning)."
    subagent: "A Claude Code micro-agent performing isolated tasks (UI, file editing, code writing)."
    specification: "A complete and unambiguous description of functional requirements."
    implementation_task: "A granular action item resulting in a file, function, or module."
    done_definition: "The output is fully functional, meets success criteria, passes quality validation, and produces no ambiguity."

  workflow:

    - "/sp.constitution":
        description: "Establishes rules, terminology, and governance. Must be created once at project start."

    - "/sp.specify":
        description: |
          Produces the full functional specification.  
          Must be:
          - technology-agnostic  
          - measurable  
          - testable  
          - complete  
          - free of implementation details  
          This becomes the contract for the entire project.

    - "/sp.plan":
        description: |
          Converts the specification into a full architectural plan.  
          Includes:
          - phases  
          - sequence  
          - dependencies  
          - system architecture diagrams  
          - high-level data flow  
          - agent interactions  

    - "/sp.tasks":
        description: |
          Breaks the plan into tasks.  
          Every task must:
          - Have a clear description  
          - Output must be a file, module, component, or behavior  
          - Include acceptance criteria  
          - Be ordered by dependency  

    - "/sp.implement":
        description: |
          Claude Code + Subagents create actual code, files, and components.  
          All output must:
          - match tasks exactly  
          - pass automated quality checks  
          - never diverge from specification  
          - avoid duplication  
          - maintain full readability  

  quality_standards:

    specifications:

      - must include success criteria
      - must avoid naming technologies
      - must avoid implementation details
      - must define user stories clearly

    plans:
      - must include architecture diagrams (text-based)
      - must detail component boundaries
      - must describe agent responsibilities
      - must describe data pipelines
      - must show cross-phase dependencies

    tasks:
      - must be ≤ 200 tasks total
      - each task outputs something concrete
      - each task must be unambiguous and testable
      - each task must map back to a requirement

    implementations:
      - must use Claude Code subagents for file operations
      - must follow clean architecture
      - must not produce unused files
      - must ensure consistency across backend, frontend, agents
      - must not exceed hackathon complexity limits

  constraints:

    general:
      - No hallucinations permitted.
      - No unstated assumptions unless explicitly validated.
      - No mixing of specification and implementation in wrong phases.

    frontend:
      - Must use Docusaurus.
      - Must maintain high readability for textbook typography.
      - Urdu translation must support RTL.
      - Chatbot must elegantly overlay as a floating assistant.

    backend:
      - Must use FastAPI.
      - Must use Gemini 2.5 Flash + Embeddings.
      - Must use Qdrant Cloud vector DB.
      - PostgreSQL optional unless personalization/auth required.

    rag:
      - Answers must include citations.
      - Chunking must avoid cutting sentences mid-way.
      - Retrieval must use cosine similarity or default Qdrant scoring.
      - Selected text override must be supported.

    translation:
      - Urdu must preserve meaning, tone, and formatting.
      - RTL CSS must apply only in Urdu mode.

    personalization:
      - Logic must depend on user background metadata.
      - Must not alter core meaning of content.

    agents:
      - Each agent must have a narrow responsibility.
      - All agents must report to the master orchestrator agent.
      - Claude Code subagents must be used for code-generation workflows.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - All hackathon requirements implemented.
    - All bonus features implemented:
        * Subagents  
        * Personalization  
        * Urdu translation
