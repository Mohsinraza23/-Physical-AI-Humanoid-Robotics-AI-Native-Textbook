## 🚀 Introduction

This repository contains the **AI-generated educational textbook**  
**“Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — AI-Native Edition”**,  
created using **SpecifyPlus**, **Gemini API**, and **Claude-Code Router**.  

A fully automated system that generates complete book content  
with chapters, sections, explanations, and diagrams.

## ⚙️ Install Requirements (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Install the SpecifyPlus framework
pip install specifyplus

# Verify installation
specifyplus --version
💾 Create Project Folder
powershell
Copy code
# Move to Desktop
cd ~/Desktop

# Create project folder
mkdir robotics-ai-book
cd robotics-ai-book
📘 Initialize the Project
powershell
Copy code
# Initialize SpecifyPlus system
specifyplus init .

# Run Claude or Gemini or Quen
📚 Book Generation Workflow
1️⃣ /sp.constitution — Defines the entire rule system for the book.
2️⃣ /sp.specify — Full functional requirements, tech-agnostic.
3️⃣ /sp.plan — Architecture & phased plan.
4️⃣ /sp.tasks — Breaks plan into actionable tasks.
5️⃣ /sp.implement — Code generation with Claude + subagents.

📝 Constitution & Specification
Constitution
Version: 1.0

Purpose:
Defines workflow, rules, quality standards, and constraints for producing a fully AI-native textbook & RAG system. Ensures outputs are structured, testable, and hackathon-ready.

Guiding Principles:

Outputs must be deterministic, structured, and testable.

No hallucinations or unstated assumptions.

Each requirement maps to tasks; tasks map to implementations.

UI/UX must be professional and academic.

Multi-agent architecture must remain modular.

RAG system must be accurate and citation-focused.

Urdu translation must preserve meaning & formatting.

Personalization must respect user metadata.

Key Components:

Agents & Subagents (file-writing, planning, code generation, UI)

RAG system: chunking, embeddings, vector search, answer generation

Functional requirements: textbook reading, chatbot, Urdu translation, personalization, auth, dashboard, quizzes, subagents

Non-functional requirements: performance, latency, responsiveness, accessibility, concurrency

Acceptance criteria: All hackathon base + bonus features deployed, demo < 90s

Functional Specification (/sp.specify)
Project Name: AI-Native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Platform

Objective:
Create a complete AI-native textbook system teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, including:

Full interactive textbook

Built-in RAG chatbot

Select-text-based question answering

Urdu translation (RTL)

User personalization

Authentication & dashboards

Multi-agent support with reusable intelligence

Deployable frontend + backend

Scope:

In-Scope:

AI-native textbook experience with responsive UI & TOC

Chapter navigation & RAG chatbot

Urdu translation mode (RTL)

Personalized dashboards based on user metadata

Subagent-based code generation workflows

Frontend deployment: GitHub Pages / Vercel

Backend deployment: Cloud server

Out-of-Scope:

Real robot control or simulation

Hardware execution

Functional Requirements (User Stories):

US1: Read multi-chapter textbook

US2: Ask questions via RAG chatbot

US3: Translate chapters to Urdu (RTL)

US4: Personalize content

US5: Authentication system

US6: Dashboard with progress & recommendations

US7: AI-generated summaries & quizzes

US8: Multi-agent architecture with subagents

Non-Functional Requirements:

Load < 2s, Chatbot latency < 2s

RAG accuracy ≥ 90%

Mobile responsive, WCAG AA accessibility

Minimum 100 concurrent visitors

Edge Cases:

Empty or non-English selection → fallback to full book

Urdu translation excludes code blocks

Long chapters → chunking preserves sentences

Chatbot asked outside-book questions → limitation notice

Acceptance Criteria:

All user stories implemented

All bonus features included

Deployable frontend + backend

Clean GitHub repo

Textbook professional & readable

Chatbot accurate with citations

Demo < 90s

🎯 Next Steps
/sp.plan — Architecture & phased plan

/sp.tasks — Break plan into tasks

/sp.implement — Generate code using Claude & subagents

Deployment — Frontend: GitHub Pages / Vercel, Backend: Cloud
