## 🚀 Introduction
This is **not a normal textbook**.  
This is the **first fully AI-native educational platform** that teaches **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** — completely generated by autonomous AI agents.

No human wrote a single chapter.  
Everything — from content to code to design — was created using a multi-agent system powered by **SpecifyPlus**.

# Spec-Kit Plus Constitution  
# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — AI-Native Textbook System  
# Gemini 2.5 Flash Edition — Multi-Agent, RAG, Urdu Translation, Personalization

constitution:

  version: 1.0

  purpose: |
    This constitution defines the governing rules, workflow, terminology,
    quality bar, and constraints for producing a fully AI-native technical
    textbook and RAG system using Spec-Kit Plus, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude Code,
    and Qdrant Cloud.  
    It ensures all generated outputs (specifications, plans, tasks, and
    implementations) follow a unified structure, are verifiable, and produce a
    complete hackathon-ready textbook platform.

  guiding_principles:
    - All outputs must be deterministic, structured, testable, complete,
      and technology-agnostic unless the phase explicitly requires implementation detail.
    - The LLM must never hallucinate features or add unstated requirements.
    - Every requirement must map to tasks; every task must map to implemented files.
    - UI/UX must follow professional textbook standards (clean, readable, academic).
    - Multi-agent architecture must remain modular and maintainable.
    - The RAG system must be accurate, high-recall, and citation-focused.
    - Translation workflows must maintain semantic accuracy in Urdu.
    - Personalization logic must respect user background metadata.
    - All components must meet the hackathon scoring criteria.

  definitions:
    ai_native_book: "A technical textbook built with Docusaurus that supports AI assistance, RAG, translation, personalization, and interactive features."
    rag_system: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture including chunking, embeddings, vector search, and answer generation."
    agent: "An AI module with a specialized function (retrieval, translation, personalization, file-writing, planning)."
    subagent: "A Claude Code micro-agent performing isolated tasks (UI, file editing, code writing)."
    specification: "A complete and unambiguous description of functional requirements."
    implementation_task: "A granular action item resulting in a file, function, or module."
    done_definition: "The output is fully functional, meets success criteria, passes quality validation, and produces no ambiguity."

  workflow:

    - "/sp.constitution":
        description: "Establishes rules, terminology, and governance. Must be created once at project start."

    - "/sp.specify":
        description: |
          Produces the full functional specification.  
          Must be:
          - technology-agnostic  
          - measurable  
          - testable  
          - complete  
          - free of implementation details  
          This becomes the contract for the entire project.
